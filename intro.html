<p><span style="text-align: left;font-weight: bold;">More than half of UK councils have declared a 'climate emergency'. This tool is designed to support local councils by visualising open data relating to climate change. Just select your local authority and hit the 'Build slides' button to create a slide pack of visualisations.</span></p>
